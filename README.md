ABSTRACT
Recent research has underscored the vital role of personalized food recommendation
systems in fostering healthy eating habits. A fresh methodology has been proposed,
employing constrained question answering on a food knowledge base to adeptly
amalgamate individual preferences and health guidelines.
Moreover, in response to the inadequacies of prevailing diet apps in furnishing clinical
substantiation, the introduction of DIETOS (DIET Organizer System) has been pivotal. This
system furnishes customized nutritional advice grounded in real-time health profiles,
aiming to rectify the dearth of clinical evidence in mainstream diet apps. Leveraging a
repertoire of Calabrian foods, DIETOS endeavors to ameliorate overall health outcomes via
tailored dietary counsel.
Aligned with these tenets, our endeavor centers on crafting an Indian diet recommendation
system. This platform serves as a comprehensive repository, showcasing a plethora of
Indian recipes alongside their respective health merits. Additionally, the system
encompasses a dedicated segment for Ayurvedic diet recommendations, catering to those
seeking holistic dietary approaches. Equipped with functionalities such as real-time health
profile evaluation and personalized nutritional suggestions, our system endeavors to
empower users in making informed dietary decisions and augmenting their overall wellbeing.


Motivation
In the face of rising health issues stemming from modern lifestyles and exacerbated by the
COVID-19 pandemic, there is a critical need to prioritize preventive healthcare and overall
wellness. Our solution lies in bridging the gap between modernity and tradition by leveraging
technology to promote awareness and empower individuals to make informed choices about
their health. By tapping into the nutritional wealth of traditional Indian cuisine and ancient
Ayurvedic wisdom, we can offer a holistic approach to well-being that nourishes the body,
mind, and soul. Our vision is to create a platform that serves as a comprehensive guide to
rediscovering the nutritional benefits of Indian cuisine, providing authentic recipes, detailed
nutritional information, and preparation guidelines to enable individuals to take charge of their
health and well-being.


Problem statement
"Developing an app to promote Indian Ayurvedic recipes and improve health by shifting focus
from foreign to indigenous cuisine."
